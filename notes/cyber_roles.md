# Cybersecurity Roles Reflection

## Which team excites you the most right now?
-Purple team!
I'm excited by the idea of mastering both offense and defense, and becoming someone who understands the whole battlefield.

## Why do you think both Red and Blue Teams are needed?
-Red team and Blue team both play critical roles.
The Red Team simulates real attackers- they think like hackers, find weaknesses, and tests the system's resilience.
The Blue Team defendes systems in real-time- they detect, resopnd, and protects from attacks.
They need each other to continuously improve security.

## Do you want to specialize later or stay Purple?

-Purple.
I prefere not to be limited to one side- I want to understands attcks deeply, and also be strong in defense, I want to the brain behind both.
